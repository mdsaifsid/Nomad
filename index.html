     <p>Once upon a time! in 001 years
     There was a group of Nomads(banjara). Usually, they travel in search of food and shelter but these were of a different kind. They travel according to their master in a path to spread happiness among sad or worried ones.</p>
     
     
     <p>While traveling they found a City(City A).In which people were very kind, friendly, and had a smile on their faces every time. The people of the City gave some source of light to the Nomads, the Nomads was confused about the light and enquired about the source of it.<img class="city1" src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2016%2F01%2Fhallstadt-austria.jpg"> They asked the City about the source of light and why it came to them. The people denied having any kind of light or its source towards the Nomads. The Nomads tried a lot to know the reason for light but couldn't find it. It took 002 years to find the source then they got to know that the light coming to them belongs to another City which was given by City A. Because the Nomads were good people according to City A. Nomads didn't talk with the people for many days.
     
      
      <p> So, they decided to move to another place as they travel accordingly. Everything was ready and they began to move. The people of the City came to stop them and said "Don't go! Don't go!". But it was very late they might have stopped but due to the light, they need to go. Because someone else deserves that light. They can't take someone else light for their well being. Everyone cried, as it was the moment of departure there was grief among all and they said their words "Whenever you feel sad we are here for you" by saying this they left.</p>
     
     
     <p>Then the Nomads traveled in deserts for a long time with loneliness and grief due to the separation of such good people.</p>
     
     
     <p>One morning while they were traveling they went nearby a City and heard a sound of people in mourn or crying. The Nomads decided to help them and entered the place. At first sight, they saw the people were beautiful and innocent but the whole place was destroyed by a disaster. And the disaster was caused by a neighboring City which acted friendly but ended up showing the true colors of being a traitor.</p>
     
     
     <p>The city was undergoing a Tsunami and the people were depressed due to it. The Nomads brought the people to the safe place and healed the damage done by the Tsunami. However, people didn't recover from the wounds of disaster but the Nomads help them to recover from wounds and depression as well. They helped them to build their beautiful City again but, this time a stronger and beautiful one. The City again witnessed the happiness of its people and the people decided to celebrate it on their rebuild to a new version of them. They decorated the city and exchanged gifts among them as a sign of retaliation against the destruction.</p>

     <p>As time passed the city developed to its original state and now, the Nomads need to leave as the city doesn't belong to them, and according to their master they must move from the place after spreading happiness. The people weren't ready to let them go. Because they think the Nomads healed them and if they go their happiness will be compromised. But, the happiness was sent by God, and Nomads delivered it to them. The people should let them go and remember this "Whenever you feel sad we are here for you"</p>
